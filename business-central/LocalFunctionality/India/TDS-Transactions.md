### <a name="tds-to-be-calculated-on-vendor-invoice-through-general-journal-purchase-journal-purchase-invoice-or-purchase-order"></a>TDS to be calculated on vendor invoice (through general journal, purchase journal, purchase invoice or purchase order)

In the given scenario, vendor has issued an invoice for INR 50,000 on which 2% TDS is applicable under TDS Section 194C.
  
  - In this case TDS calculation will be as following:

    |Component|Value|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**TDS Base Amount**|50000|  
    |**TDS Amount**|1000 (50000*2%)|

  - On posting of invoice, GL Entries will be as following:
     
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Expense Account**|50000| 
    |**TDS Payable Account**|-1000| 
    |**Vendor Account**|-49000|

### <a name="tds-to-be-calculated-on-vendor-advance-payment-through-general-journal-or-payment-journal"></a>TDS to be calculated on vendor advance payment (through general journal or payment journal)

In the given scenario, advance payment made to vendor for INR 50,000 on which 2% TDS is applicable under TDS Section 194C.

  - In this case TDS calculation will be as following:

    |Component|Value|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|

    |**Bank Account**|-49000|

On receiving the invoice from the vendor, TDS will be calculated on the differential amount. Suppose vendor sent an invoice of INR 120000. Since TDS has already been calculated at the time of payment, at the time of invoicing TDS will be calculated on the remaining amount i.e. INR 70000 (1200000 - 50000).

> [!NOTE]
> Advance payment needs to be applied with the invoice before posting. Otherwise TDS will be calculated on the whole invoice amount.

  - In this case TDS calculation will be as following:

    |Component|Value|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
