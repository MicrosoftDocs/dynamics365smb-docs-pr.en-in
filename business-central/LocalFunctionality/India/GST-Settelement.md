[!INCLUDE[vnext_preview](../../includes/vnext_preview.md)]

Settlement refers to discharge of tax liability to the government. Tax liability arises for scenarios mentioned below: 
- Outward Supplies (Sales, Transfers) 
- Inward Supplies that are subject to Reverse charge (Purchases, Inward Transfers)
- Credit Reversal Adjustments 
- Negative Credit from Purchase Transactions 
- Negative Credit for ISD Distributions 

This tax liability on both interstate transactions (IGST) and intrastate transactions (SGST/UTGST, CGST) is to be discharged on a monthly basis to the government. GST paid on purchase transactions can be taken as credit subject to certain conditions. Such credit can be offset against the tax payable on Sales. Hence, GST payable on sales transactions can be discharged by payment of cash or utilisation of credit or both. Reverse charge Liability shall always be discharged in cash. Credit can be availed in the month of tax remittance to the government. Credit utilised can be credit pertaining to the same component or different components. 

- As per GST Law, credit of IGST, CGST and SGST/UTGST shall be claimed in the chronological order as given below: 

    |GST Component|GST Setoff Component|Priority|
    |----------------------------------|-----|---------------------------------------|
    |**IGST**|CGST|1|
    |**IGST**|SGST|2|
    |**CGST**|IGST|1|
    |**SGST**|IGST|1|  

The first priority for any component would be that component itself. This logic is inbuilt. The above table is setting priorities for other components.
